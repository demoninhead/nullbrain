# Intro

**`"IF YOU CAN'T FLY, THEN RUN. IF YOU CAN'T RUN, THEN WALK. IF YOU CAN'T WALK, THEN CRAWL. BUT BY ALL MEANS, KEEP MOVING." - MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.`**

ðŸš§ This is WIP and obviously going to get lots of updates as i get time outside of my working & babysitting hours :\). ðŸš¼

This is the start of my offsec journey. And, here I am trying to contribute back my 2 cents and wishful thinking of making this source available for those looking to start their offsec journey.
