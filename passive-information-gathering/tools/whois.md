# Whois

**WHOIS** \(pronounced as the phrase "who is"\) is a query and response [protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol) that is widely used for querying [databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) that store the registered users or assignees of an [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet) resource, such as a [domain name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name), an [IP address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) block or an [autonomous system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_%28Internet%29), but is also used for a wider range of other information. The protocol stores and delivers database content in a human-readable format.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHOIS#cite_note-rfc3912-1) The current iteration of the WHOIS protocol was drafted by the [Internet Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Society), and is documented in [RFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFC_%28identifier%29) [3912](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3912).
