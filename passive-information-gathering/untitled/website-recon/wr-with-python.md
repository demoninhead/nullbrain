# WR with Python

**`"('python' or "python")". - @demoninhead`**

While doing this writeup, I cannot stop myself but recommend Violent Python [book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Violent-Python-Cookbook-Penetration-Engineers/dp/1597499579/). This book is something in my read list but hasn't got the chance to complete yet.
