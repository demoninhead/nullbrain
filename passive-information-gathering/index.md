### Information Gathering

`"TIME SPENT IN RECONNAISSANCE IS SELDOM WASTED." - JOHN MARSDEN`

#### Passive Information Gathering

Open-source Intelligence Or OSINT is generally referred to as passive information gathering.

In simple terms, it's about collecting openly available information about a target without any direct interaction with the target.

A recurrent process which clarifies or expands an attack surface which helps us conduct a successful phishing camping or supplements another penetration testing.
